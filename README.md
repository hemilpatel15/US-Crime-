# 🌍 Global Health Statistics Analysis & Dashboard

## 📌 Description

This project focuses on the analysis of global health statistics to provide insights into healthcare access, income disparities, and health outcomes across different regions. By cleaning and preparing the data, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applying machine learning models, the project uncovers valuable patterns and trends. An interactive Tableau dashboard has been created to visualize the findings and provide a business perspective on key health metrics. This dashboard allows stakeholders to interact with the data and make informed decisions based on feature importance and model performance.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Programming**: Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Visualization**: Tableau
- **ML Models**: Linear Regression, Random Forest

## 🧹 Data Preparation

- Handled missing values and inconsistencies using **Pandas** and **NumPy**
- Standardized formats and cleaned the dataset for analysis and modeling

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Used **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizing:
  - Health access across income groups
  - Regional disparities in outcomes
  - Correlation between variables like income and life expectancy

## 🤖 Machine Learning

- Developed predictive models:
  - **Linear Regression** for baseline modeling
  - **Random Forest** for improved performance and feature importance analysis
- Evaluated using:
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
  - **R² Score**

## 📈 Interactive Dashboard

- Created an interactive dashboard in **Tableau** to:
  - Visualize key findings
  - Highlight feature importance
  - Support data-driven policy and business decisions

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

- Income level and healthcare access are strongly correlated with health outcomes
- Random Forest outperformed Linear Regression in predictive accuracy
- Dashboard provides a high-level summary for stakeholders and decision-makers
